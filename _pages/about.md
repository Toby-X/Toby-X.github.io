Hi, everyone! Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a senior student in Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, double major in Mathematics and Physics, as well as Energy and Power Engineering. 

Along with my undergraduate studies, I am advised by Professor [Ke Deng](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/kdeng/) and Dr. [Yichao Li](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/yichao-li) in Tsinghua concerning the behavior of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). In the summer, I am guided by Professor [Yuqi Gu](https://stat.columbia.edu/~yuqigu/) at Columbia University in mixture models and spectral methods.

I am generally intrigued by how to discover knowledge in a data-driven manner and further how to make decisions based on observations. My past research experiences have focused on better and efficient estimation of statistical models. I am interested in methods and their theoretical properties. I am also eager to apply interpretable statistical methods to data arised in physics, biology, social sciences and engineering.
